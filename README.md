# APT-Casino üé≤üé∞

Amaan Sayyad the founder of APT-Casino was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement of https://stake.com/ which was giving a 200% bonus on the first deposit somehow he got attracted to it and deposited 120 USDT into Stake platform, Stake gave him 360 USDT as the total balance and when he started playing game he was shocked to see that he was only able to place bet of default $1 per game of Plinko Casino Game on Stake.com and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 because he was using the bonus scheme of 200% and when he tried to explore and play other games on the platform he got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits.

When he tried to withdraw money they showed him this rule list of wager limits which said that if he wanted to withdraw the deposited amount then he had to play $12,300 worth of games this was a big shock for him when he was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back, he played the game Plinko the entire night and lost all his money.
